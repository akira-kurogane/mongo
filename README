MongoDB README

This is a branch forked from MongoDB v4.0.3

UTILITIES

  ftdc_dump         - Create a binary dump of the contents of a database.

BUILDING

  You're currently in the "ftdc_dump_40" branch. To sanity-check run 'git branch' to see this before trying to compile the ftdc_dump program with the commands below.


  Before building you will need to install the same prerequisites that you would for building the core server (see docs/building.md).

  After making sure you have installed the MongoDB source code build prerequisites the ftdc_dump executable using the following command.

  $ buildscripts/scons.py ftdc_dump

  The build is nowhere near as big as it is for the mongod server build but you can add the -j <num_of_cores> option to enable parallelized building to speed it up a little. Also use --disable-warnings-as-errors to allow warnings to stay just as warnings.

  This will create the executable at build/opt/mongo/db/ftdc/ftdc_dump and also install/copy in the top directory.

  (You can build the server code and other utility programs as normal (see the docs/building.md documentation, or the README file in the normal "v4.0" branch) but that is not the point of this branch.)

RUNNING

  For command line options invoke:

    $ ./ftdc_dump --help
