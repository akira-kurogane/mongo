 * start_ts is the first "start" value from the kMetricChunks in all files.
 * estimate_end_ts is "start" + (metricCount * 1 sec) of the last
 * kMetricChunk in the last file.
 *
 * The files are packed in a tuple with the "_id" date value in the
 * kMetadataDoc as the first value to make it easy to identify when we've
 * received the same file. It may be a newer, larger version of the same
 * file and if it so should replace. If not we can ignore using that file
 * because it must be a duplicate or an earlier, shorter version.
 *
 * lastRefDoc is the last refDoc member from the last kMetricChunk from all
 * files loaded so far. It will probably have many more dozens of metrics in it
 * than the very first refDoc created when the process started.
